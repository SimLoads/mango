MANGOCORE

[0cMg]
 - Failed to find Mangotools - The folder that mango's tools are in couldn't be found. Try reinstalling Mango.
[0cIc]
 - Directory name contains illegal characters - The current working directory has illegal characters. Try removing them. Keep in mind these characters should also be removed from target directories.
[0cUf]
 - Failed to find unzip.bat - Occurs on Windows only. This isn't exactly fixable by yourself, but I'm working on it.
[0cFm]
 - Unzip failed - Mango could not find any files in the output folder. Try performing an unzip again, or manually move files into output_temp.
[0cMd]
 - Unzip failed - A pretty common error, usually occurs if the chosen folder for code already has an unpacked module in it. Try deleting the module from the target folder and try again.
[0cRm]
 - Not a huge problem, just may cause a few problems with the next unpack. Delete output_temp from mangotools manually to prevent any potential errors, though I'm not sure there would be any.
[0cNf]
 - Unzip failed - output_temp couldn't be found. For whatever reason a fatal error occured, try running the program again, maybe from a different directory.
[0cDm]
 - Failed to complete unzip - Mango couldn't move output_temp out of the target wheel directory. Not sure what exactly causes this but it's annoying and Python can't seem to sort itself out about it, working on a fix.
[0cRd]
 - Failed to rename output - This is mainly an os.rename function problem because Python won't return shell errors. Try elevated privelages.
[0cOf]
 - Failed to create output file - Fatal error, I have no idea what may cause this. I'm working on a way around it.
[1cId]
 - Invalid code directory - The selected directory doesn't exist. Ensure it was entered correctly.
[1cPe]
 - Package already exists - The package has already been unpacked in the selected destination. Mango will auto overwrite the package, but it's just letting you know beforehand.
[1cFd]
 - Failed to copy directory - Usually triggered by invalid directory naming, usually Mango's fault. Working on a fix.
[1cNp]
 - No .py files found - No Python files were found in the target directory, therefore Mango has nothing to append to.
[1cPf]
 - Failed to open .py file - Mango couldn't read the target Python file, so could not append to it. Try again or choose a different Python file.
[1cRf]
 - Failed to remove .py file - The original Python file couldn't be removed, which would break the append function. Try again and ensure Mango has sufficient permissions to delete files.
[1cAf]
 - Failed to append - Could not append import function to Python file. Try again or choose another Python file. Working on a fix.
[2cSt]
 - Self test failed - Triggered by no internet connection. Mango will continue to function, but Mango is just letting you know it doesn't work.
